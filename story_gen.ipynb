      "Conflict: Lily must use her bravery and wit to outsmart the wicked witch and save the enchanted garden from disappearing forever. The stakes are high as without the magic of the garden, all the magical creatures, including Lily's new friends, will have to leave and the land will become dull and lifeless.\n",
